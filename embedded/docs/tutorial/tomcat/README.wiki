!!! Using Embedded JBoss with Tomcat 5.5

This project is built using Ant and the build.xml file included in the tomcat directory.  There are a number ways to deploy things to Tomcat.  The examples here show a few different ways:

* ''scan.webinf.lib.war'' Ant target builds an embedded-jboss.war file in the build directory.  This war's [web.xml|resources/scan.webinf.lib.xml] is set up so that every jar in WEB-INF/lib of the war file is scanned for possible JBoss deployments.
* ''finegrain.war'' Ant target builds the war.  This war's [web.xml|resources/finegrain.web.xml] sets up a Listener that explicitly loads one particular resource from the ServletContext.
* ''builtin.war'' Ant target just builds a regular war file.  No special things were configured in web.xml.  For this example, you need to turn on default scanning at the Tomcat level.  Here's how.

After deploying the WAR to Tomcat, you can access [EmbeddedJBoss.jsp|http://localhost:8080/embedded-jboss/EmbeddedJBoss.jsp] to test the example.
