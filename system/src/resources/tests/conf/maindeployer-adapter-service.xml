<!--
   Load in the existing server a MainDeployerAdapter that in turn
   wires up a new MainDeployer with a couple of AspectDeployers.
   
   Setup a URLDeploymentScanner to scan ./deploy2 and contact the
   MainDeployerAdapter instead of the old MainDeployer.
   
   (We could use a VDFDeploymentScanner instead.)
   
   Finally, setup a VDFComponentFactory for the MainDeployerAdapter
   with a VDFLoaderService wrapper. It'll use tmp/deploy2 for making
   local copies and unpacking of jars.

      <!-- The URLComparator can be used to specify a deployment ordering
           for deployments found in a scanned directory.  The class specified
           must be an implementation of java.util.Comparator, it must be able
           to compare two URL objects, and it must have a no-arg constructor.
           Two deployment comparators are shipped with JBoss:
             - org.jboss.deployment.DeploymentSorter
               Sorts by file extension, as follows:
                 "sar", "service.xml", "rar", "jar", "war", "wsr", "ear", "zip",
                 "*"
             - org.jboss.deployment.scanner.PrefixDeploymentSorter
               If the name portion of the url begins with 1 or more digits, those
               digits are converted to an int (ignoring leading zeroes), and
               files are deployed in that order.  Files that do not start with
               any digits will be deployed first, and they will be sorted by
               extension as above with DeploymentSorter.

         this follows RFC2518 convention and allows discrimination between
         collections and directories that are simply unpacked archives.

         URLs may be local (file:) or remote (http:). Scanning is supported
         for remote URLs but unpacked deployment units are not.

         Example URLs:

                 scans ${jboss.server.url}/deploy/, which is local or remote
                 depending on the URL used to boot the server
            ${jboss.server.home}/deploy/
                 scans ${jboss.server.home)/deploy, which is always local
            file:/var/opt/myapp.ear
