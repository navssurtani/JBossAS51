      <!-- The URLComparator can be used to specify a deployment ordering
           for deployments found in a scanned directory.  The class specified
           must be an implementation of java.util.Comparator, it must be able
           to compare two URL objects, and it must have a no-arg constructor.
           Two deployment comparators are shipped with JBoss:
             - org.jboss.deployment.DeploymentSorter
               Sorts by file extension, as follows:
                 "sar", "service.xml", "rar", "jar", "war", "wsr", "ear", "zip",
                 "*"
             - org.jboss.deployment.scanner.PrefixDeploymentSorter
               If the name portion of the url begins with 1 or more digits, those
               digits are converted to an int (ignoring leading zeroes), and
               files are deployed in that order.  Files that do not start with
               any digits will be deployed first, and they will be sorted by
               extension as above with DeploymentSorter.

      <!-- URLs are comma separated and resolve relative to the server home URL
         unless the given path is absolute. If the URL ends in "/" it is
         considered a collection and scanned, otherwise it is simply deployed;
         this follows RFC2518 convention and allows discrimination between
         collections and directories that are simply unpacked archives.

         URLs may be local (file:) or remote (http:). Scanning is supported
         for remote URLs but unpacked deployment units are not.

         Example URLs:
            deploy/
                 scans ${jboss.server.url}/deploy/, which is local or remote
                 depending on the URL used to boot the server
            ${jboss.server.home}/deploy/
                 scans ${jboss.server.home)/deploy, which is always local
            file:/var/opt/myapp.ear
                 deploy myapp.ear from a local location
            file:/var/opt/apps/

            http://www.test.com/netboot/myapp.ear
                 deploys myapp.ear from a remote location
            http://www.test.com/netboot/apps/
